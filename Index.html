            <div class="innholdInformasjon"><h2>What do turtles eat?</h2>
                 Turtles are omnivorous and their diet can vary depending on their species, <br>
                 habitat and age. Some turtles are primarily herbivorous, <br>
                 while others are mainly carnivorous or omnivorous. <br><br>
                 Herbivorous turtles typically feed on a variety of plant materials such as <br> grasses, leaves, fruits, and vegetables. <br>
                 They also consume aquatic plants such as algae and duckweed. <br><br>
                 Carnivorous turtles primarily feed on fish, insects, worms, crustaceans, and other small animals. <br><br>
                 Omnivorous turtles have a mixed diet that includes both plant and animal matter. <br>
                 They may eat a combination of fruits, vegetables, insects, and small animals. <br><br>
                 It's important to note that the specific diet of a turtle will depend on their species and their individual needs. <br>
                 Consult with a veterinarian or a specialist in turtle care to determine the most appropriate diet for your pet turtle.

                It's difficult to estimate the exact number of turtles in captivity worldwide, <br>
                as there is no centralized database or registry. <br><br>
                However, it is believed that millions of turtles are kept in captivity around the world <br>
                as pets, for food, and for other uses such as traditional medicine.<br><br>
                When kept as pets, turtles require special care to ensure their health and well-being. <br>
                Here are some important considerations for keeping turtles in captivity:<br><br>
                Habitat: Turtles require a suitable habitat that meets their specific needs,<br>
                including appropriate lighting, temperature, humidity, and space to move around.<br><br>
                Diet: Turtles in captivity require a balanced diet that meets their nutritional needs. <br>
                Depending on their species, this may include a mix of vegetables, fruits,<br>
                and protein sources such as insects, fish, and other animals. <br><br>
                Cleanliness: Turtles require a clean environment to stay healthy. <br>
                Their habitat should be cleaned regularly, and their water should be changed frequently.<br><br>
                Health care: Regular check-ups with a veterinarian who is knowledgeable about<br>
                turtle care can help ensure that your pet is healthy and receiving appropriate care.<br><br>
                Overall, keeping a turtle in captivity requires a significant commitment of time and resources <br>
                to ensure that they receive the proper care and attention they need to thrive.<br><br>
